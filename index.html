    <p>I am a third year Biostatistics & Bioinformatics PhD student at Duke University. I study the use
      of machine learning to facilitate causal inference in medicine. I am advised by
      <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/">Cynthia Rudin</a>, <a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/profile/david-page">David
      Page</a>, and <a href="https://volfovsky.github.io/">Alexander Volfovsky</a>.</p>

    <p>Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Data Scientist at Optum and received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics
    from Loyola Marymount University where I was advised by
