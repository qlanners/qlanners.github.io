    <p>I am a fourth year Biostatistics & Bioinformatics PhD candidate at Duke University. I study the use
      of machine learning to facilitate interpretable causal inference, with a particular focus on addressing the growing
      complexity of real-world data. I am advised by
      <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~cynthia/">Cynthia Rudin</a>, <a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/profile/david-page">David
      Page</a>, and <a href="https://volfovsky.github.io/">Alexander Volfovsky</a>.</p>

    <p>In Summer 2024, I interned as a Research Scientist at Meta, developing an approach for offline
      evaluation of ad-ranking models. Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Data Scientist at Optum and received my
      B.S. in Applied Mathematics from Loyola Marymount University where I was advised by
      <a href="http://thomaslaurent.lmu.build/homepage.html">Thomas Laurent</a>.</p>
