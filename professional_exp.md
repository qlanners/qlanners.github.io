 **Ph.D. Candidate**, Durham, NC, Aug 2021 - Current

- Developed interpretable method for estimating dynamic treatment regimes that reduced the probability of an adverse 
medical event by over 20 percentage points when operationalized on a real-world ICU dataset. 
- Engineered new method for large scale, computationally inexpensive, and interpretable causal inference that is over 
100 times faster than existing benchmarks.

 **Research Scientist Intern**, Seattle, WA, May 2024 - Aug 2024 
 
- Wrote an internal technical report detailing a domain-adapted model-based approach for offline counterfactual 
evaluation of ranking models. Work accepted as short paper to the 2024 Causality, Counterfactuals, & Sequential 
Decision-Making workshop at RecSys  and the 2024 Conference on Digital Experimentation @ MIT. 
- Provided empirical and theoretical results showing the settings under which different variants of the proposed 
approach are better than existing benchmarks.
