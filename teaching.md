I have experience serving as a tutor and teaching assistant from my time as an undergraduate and graduate
student. My core philosophy as a teacher revolves around *listening* to my students. 

My interest in teaching led me to pursue a second job as a teaching assistant with Trilogy Education Services while I 
was working in industry at Optum. As a TA for an eight-month post-graduate "Boot Camp" on data analytics and visualization,
I worked with a variety of different students with stark differences in their backgrounds.

In addition to teaching in an academic setting, I also currently work as a dog trainer at Whole Dog Institute in Durham, NC.
In this role, I teach classes and 1-1 lessons, focusing on building a strong bond between dog and owner through positive 
reinforcement training. 

My collection of teaching experiences have stressed the importance of *listening*. Each student (or dog) 
has a different background and brings different strengths to the table and the more I can connect with them the better I
can understand how they learn and ultimately help them succeed.
