I research the use of machine learning to facilitate interpretable causal inference, with a particular focus
on medical applications. My recent work includes estimating dynamic treatment regimes for ICU patients,
developing an interpretable method for observational causal inference, and creating a variant of multilabel learning 
to improve the prediction of rare clinical events. My collaborations span statistics, computer science, medicine, and chemistry.
