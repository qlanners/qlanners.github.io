I research the use of machine learning to facilitate interpretable causal inference, with a particular focus
on medical applications. My recent work includes estimating dynamic treatment regimes for ICU patients, developing a
matching based method for observational causal inference, and reviewing machine learning in polymer biomaterials. My
collaborations span statistics, computer science, medicine, and chemistry.
