Quinn's personal website
=====================================
This is my website, built from Edo Airoldi's custom Jekyll theme. From Edo:

"This is my custom Jekyll theme, very slightly modified from svmiller.github.io and volfovsky.github.io, plus new Academicons 1.9.1.

Much of what is contained in here is derivative of those two works. That said, do observe the `embedpdf.html` and `image.html` files in the `_includes` directory. `embedpdf.html` uses Google Docs to allow for embedding of PDF files hosted on Dropbox. `image.html` provides fancier images than what is standard for Markdown. An example use of `embedpdf.html` can be observed in the `cv.md` file. An example use of `image.html` can be observed in the `about.md` file.

SVMiller's template uses data-driven navigation, which you can see in the `menu.yml` file in the `_data` directory. There's also a `nav.html` file in the `_includes` directory with modified `header.html`.

Mobile support is  functional, though some white-spacing could be improved. 

`css` and `_sass` directories also functional, if a bit cluttered. Do observe new colors I created for `$clemson-orange` and `$clemson-purple` in `css/main.scss`.

Contact me at airoldi@temple.edu. Better yet, contact Steven at svmille@clemson.edu, and thank him for the useful code he released."
